# VPN

In recent years, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) have gained popularity as a go-to solution for online privacy and security. Many “trusted” privacy-related websites emphasize using VPNs to protect yourself from surveillance, censorship, and other online threats. However, a deeper dive into the subject reveals there’s more to the story. Here are a few key issues often glossed over by these sites:

### 1. The Influence of Sponsorships

Many privacy-focused websites are sponsored by the very VPN providers they recommend, leading to a conflict of interest. The result? Biased information. These websites rarely mention the downsides of VPNs because doing so would hurt their relationships with sponsors and reduce income from affiliate links.

**Key Point:**
- Investigate whether the websites you trust are affiliated with VPN providers, as their objectivity may be compromised.

### 2. The Downsides of Using a VPN

While VPNs can offer certain privacy benefits, they are not without their disadvantages. Most websites fail to highlight the following potential downsides:

- **False Sense of Security**: Many users believe VPNs make them completely anonymous, which is untrue. VPNs only mask your IP address but don’t fully protect your online activity from tracking, especially if you're logged into social media accounts or other services.

- **Data Logging**: Some VPN providers claim to have “no-logs” policies, but there have been cases where such claims were proven false. This can put users' data at risk.

- **Speed Reduction**: VPNs often slow down internet connections, which can frustrate users trying to stream or download content.

- **Jurisdiction and Compliance**: A VPN provider's legal obligations depend on where they are headquartered. Some VPNs are located in countries with strict data retention laws, meaning they could be forced to hand over your data.

### 3. Alternatives to Using a VPN

Websites rarely mention that there are alternative ways to protect your privacy online without relying on a VPN. Some effective alternatives include:

- **Tor Browser**: Provides true anonymity by routing traffic through multiple volunteer nodes, making it much harder to trace.

- **Decentralized Networks (e.g., I2P)**: A network layer that allows applications to communicate privately and securely without the need for a centralized service.

- **Encrypted DNS Services**: Using DNS services like DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) can help protect your DNS queries from being intercepted.

These alternatives can be used on their own or in combination, depending on your specific needs.

### 4. The Risks of Using a VPN

It's important to acknowledge that VPNs can introduce their own risks. Not all VPN providers are trustworthy, and some may exploit the very data you’re trying to protect. Potential risks include:

- **VPN Provider Compromise**: If a VPN provider is hacked, or its employees act maliciously, users' data could be exposed.

- **Privacy Invasion by the VPN**: Some VPNs sell user data or monitor traffic, despite claiming otherwise.

- **IP and DNS Leaks**: Even with a VPN, poor configuration or bugs can cause leaks, revealing your real IP address or DNS queries.

### 5. The Risks of Not Using a VPN

On the flip side, failing to use a VPN in certain situations can also pose significant privacy risks, especially on unsecured public networks:

- **Unencrypted Traffic**: If you’re using public Wi-Fi without a VPN, your traffic is unencrypted and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Hackers can easily intercept sensitive data like passwords, emails, and personal information.

- **ISP Surveillance**: Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see everything you do online and may sell this data to advertisers or hand it over to government agencies.

- **Geo-Restrictions and Censorship**: Without a VPN, your online activity can be restricted based on your geographical location, limiting access to certain content or services.

### 6. VPNs and Other Privacy Tools: A Potentially Risky Combination

Using a VPN in conjunction with other privacy tools, such as Tor, can sometimes increase your risks rather than mitigate them. For example:

- **Tor Over VPN (or VPN Over Tor)**: This combination is often misunderstood. It can increase anonymity but also introduce risks, such as exit node surveillance or VPN logging.

- **VPN and Privacy Browser Plugins**: Some users stack multiple privacy tools together, like VPNs and browser extensions, but poor compatibility can lead to leaks or data conflicts.

### Conclusion

While VPNs can be useful in specific scenarios, they are not the ultimate solution to online privacy and security that some websites make them out to be. Understanding the potential risks and exploring alternatives is essential for making informed decisions about your digital privacy. Always remember that no tool is a silver bullet—it's about using the right tool for the right job and being aware of the inherent limitations.


## What Do I Recommend?

I've used Mullvad and IVPN in the past, and I can recommend both. They are privacy-focused VPN providers with a solid reputation within the privacy community. However, it’s essential to remember that no VPN is perfect. You should always do thorough research before choosing a VPN, and consider using other privacy tools in conjunction with a VPN for enhanced security.

Though I list them in a specific order, where I prefer Mullvad over IVPN, IVPN is still a great option.

- **Mullvad**: Mullvad has consistently contributed to multiple pro-privacy projects, with their most notable contribution being to QubesOS. They also have a solid track record of not logging user data and being transparent about their practices, making them a top choice for anyone serious about privacy.

- **IVPN**: While I have less personal experience with IVPN, they have a good reputation for their strong commitment to privacy and security. They are widely respected in the community for their transparency and privacy-focused approach.

Ultimately, both are excellent choices, but remember that your privacy is best protected when you use a combination of tools and remain vigilant about online security practices.

### Compatibility

Both Mullvad and IVPN are compatible with just about any mainstream operating system, including macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux (including QubesOS). Most notably, IVPN will provide you with a normal graphical interface, configured by default, while Mullvad does not. However, some claim that graphical interfaces might increase the risk of DNS leaks. You can always use either WireGuard or OpenVPN to connect securely to either service.

Unofficial methods to connect to Mullvad using a GUI do exist, but I would recommend using the CLI for the most secure connection since the graphical interface is not officially supported by Mullvad. The CLI offers more control and avoids potential vulnerabilities that might arise from third-party tools.
