# Direct Monero

[Direct Monero](https://directmonero.com/) is a website inspired by LocalMonero, offering a platform for peer-to-peer Monero trading. The main new feature of Direct Monero is the integration of PGP keys, enhancing security and privacy for users.

## Features

- **PGP Key Integration**: Users can utilize PGP keys for secure communication and transactions.
- **Open Source**: The platform is fully open source, allowing anyone to set up their own instance.

## Warning

Please note that while Direct Monero is an open-source project, we rely on some non-open source services for hosting and infrastructure. Specifically, we use MongoDB Atlas, Vercel, and CloudFlare. Ideally, we would prefer to use entirely open-source solutions, but due to resource constraints and the lack of funding, this is not feasible at the moment.
